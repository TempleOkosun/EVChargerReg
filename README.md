# Electric Vehicle Charger Registry
<h2> Project Description </h2>
A blockchain registry for  Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. The system will track, manage and enable accurate and reliable 
data sharing on an open platform where operators provide stations to serve owners of electric vehicles and all the participants are protected from unfair practises.

<h2> Network participants </h2>
<ol>
    <li> <strong> Service Providers: </strong>
        Investors who purchased EV Charging equipment from manufacturers and rented a location in a 
        parking lot for hosting these chargers.
    </li>
    <li> <strong> Controller: </strong>
        A parking lot owner that hosts those devices or a utility company to which the device is connected
    </li>   
    <li> <strong> Users: </strong>
        Owners of electric vehicles who visit a location to charge their vehicles.
    </li>  
</ol>

<h2> Problem </h2>
With the improvement in battery technology, and incentives from various governments we are seeing an increase in demand 
for electric vehicles. An open blockchain platform to cater for more Charging Station, tracking and managing them in an
environment with multiple participating Service Provider will be very useful.
