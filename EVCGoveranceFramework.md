  ## EVC Governance Framework Documentation 

  ### Overview
  The Electric Vehicle Charger (EVC) Platform Governance Framework is the legal foundation for the blockchain-based EVC network - an IoT registry for private sectors.   

Members that constitute the EVC platform are manufacturers/operators of the EV charging systems. The project is open source and allows any organizations of this nature to join.   

The EVC Platform Governance framework supports the system by executing the various agreements relating to the management of or transacting in the system.  

### Motivation  
The governance framework is needed to allow deliberation on the overhead required to operate an open network of EVC devices across certain geographical areas like the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Some of the deliberations could be on:  

* Agreement on the accuracy and latest information about the controllers and their related devices on the blockchain network  
* Updates to the codes. Deliberation on features or initiatives for the next system iteration.  
* Changes to the governing rules for the governance of the platform.   
* Ideas to ensure the financial sustainability of the platform. 

## Corporate structureÂ 
The Governing Board is responsible for overseeing the EVC Governance Framework. Members that constitute the governing board are representatives from each participating party on the EVC platform. Recommendations of potential representatives that would be voted into the governing body would be provided by the participating organizations.  

It is envisioned that the governing body may be registered as a non-profit entity to allow it to carry out its activities legally.  

## Roles  
1.  **Governing Board:** This is the body responsible for making decisions related to the network and its participants.  

2.  **(Blockchain Network) Operators:** These are roles that are contributing to the infrastructure, maintenance, and financial needs of the platform conforming to the EVC Governance Framework.  

3.  **EVC Owners:** These are investors who buy EV chargers or manufacturers of EV chargers who are participants in the EV charger network.  

4.  **Developers:** These are technical staff members responsible for writing source code for the blockchain network. 

## Policies  
* **Ledger Access Policy:**  

    * Each participating party is permitted to join the network with a specified number of peers based on the governing body's approval.  
    * Each node is provisioned using the certificate provided to them at the onboarding time.
    * Transactions are started and processed by the peer nodes of the participating party.  

* **Ledger Data Policy:** 

    * Participating parties can view and edit data that is related to their EV Chargers.  
    * Devices and controllers registration
    * Devices and controllers data modification.
    * Assigning a device to a controller or changing a device controller.  

* **Governing Board Policy:** This policy centered on governing board's activities executed by consensuses like voting, board term, and the major technical decisions related to operating the network. 

# Rules  
* **Ledger Access Rules:**  
participating parties MUST register as an EVC Owner to participate in the blockchain network.  

* **Ledger Data Rules:**  
Data of each participating party MUST remain private for editing just for the entity that owns it but open for viewing to all entities.  

* **Governing Board Rules:**    
   * The Governing Board MUST be modified every three years to allow for rotation of more representatives for their contributions to the EVC platform Governance.  
   * The number of representatives on the Governing Board MUST be capped at 10.
   * Every participant MUST be given opportunities to present to the individual in Governing Board.
   * When a formal vote is required, it MUST be conducted using a voting process agreeable to the majority of the group. 

# Agreements
* **Participation Membership Agreement:** between members of the Governing Board to agree on decisions by consensus.
* **Transaction Author Agreement:** between Platform and participating party to initiate a write transaction to the EVC Ledger.
* **Transaction Endorser Agreement:** between Platform and participating party to request permission for write access to the EVC Ledger.  
* **Data Processing Agreement:** the agreement between the platform and the participating party establishes the responsibilities of complying with GDPR and other data protection regulations.  

# Membership  

**The membership process:**    
* For instructions on how to become a member, show the intention to apply. Please email us at the following address: governingboard@evcharger.com
* The participating organization will propose an individual to the current governing board. 
* The governing board will then vote to accept or decline the proposed representative.  
  
The Governing Board must constitute ten members - three founding members are elected, and the remaining seven will be voted in from among the participating parties on the platform.  

**Periodic Membership**   
Members of the Governing Board must be replaced every three years. This allows other participating organizations to have their representatives onboard.
