# Front End
<h2> Setting up the frontend </h2>
<hr>
The front end will be the interface through which users will interact with the business application.
<p> The front end has been designed with React and it connects with the fabric run time using a rest server middleware.
</p>

<h2> Steps </h2>
<ol>
    <li> <strong> Install dependencies: </strong>  Navigate to the root folder of the frontend directory and
Run <strong> npm install  </strong>to get the required dependencies. You can open the package.json file to see the required packages 
    </li>
    <li> Then the web interface will be shown at  <em> http://<strong>ip-of-frontend</strong>:3000 </em>  on your browser to see the running app
    where <strong>ip-of-frontend</strong> is configged in corresponding json file 
    </li>
</ol>

<p>In our frontend EV Charger System scenario, 
we will have 3 users representing the three participants in the business network:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Devices</li>
    <li> Controller </li>
    <li> Super Admin </li>
</ul>

<h2> Please follow these two animations that walks through the end-user interface of EV Charger</h2>
